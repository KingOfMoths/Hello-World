# Hello-World


Im Steven Holden
I like to think hard thoughts, sometimes they like to think me.
Like that one time when biology thought for 3 billion years and then I was a 100 year daydream.
For now I will get a computer to work out graph theoretic approaches to understanding biological process. 
I will be computing how form and information are related to entropic dissipation in a nested biological heirarchy
because theres so much to see and not much time.

Love and Truth are forces of nature, so I will do what I truly love.
