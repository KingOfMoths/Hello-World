# Hello-World


Im Steven Holden
I like to think hard thoughts, sometimes they think me
Like that time when biology thought for 3 billion years and then I was a 100 year daydream
So lets get a computer to work out graph theory approaches to understanding biological process 
computing how form and information are related in a nested biological heirarchy
because theres so much to see and not much time.

love and truth are both forces of nature so I will do what I truly love.
